*Modified protocol from Doyle & Doyle, Phytochme. Bull. 19:1-15(1987) and adapted frm K. Budde, March 2018.*

### Day 1

1. Sample **15 mg of leaf tissue** into tubes of a **96 extraction plate** with **2 metal beads** to each tube.
2. Freeze samples at **$-80^\circ C$** and blocks in **liquid nitrogen** and grind samples using **Genogrinder**. Perform **3-4 grinds** of **45 seconds** at **1250 rpm** followed by cooling in liquid nitrogen. Stop when material is turned into a fine powder, add eventually **centrifugation**.
3. Prepare CTAB buffer by addin beta-mercaptoethanol ($40 \mu L$ for $10 mL$ buffer, $80 mL$ buffer need $320 \mu L$)
