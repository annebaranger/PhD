# Theory

## Concept document

- [ ] Integrate Myriam last review
- [ ] Integrate ideas from GTÖ poster
- [ ] Ask Bruno review (with live feedbacks)
- [ ] Investigate the analysis workflow for decoupled effect from genetic and environment

# Sampling

- [ ] Schedule *Eschweilera* sampling for the next dry season
    - [ ] Gap year student ?
    - [ ] FTH project ?
    - [ ] Check Saint-Omer availabilities
    - [ ] Check needed material
    - [ ] Define sampling
